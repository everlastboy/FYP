                    A starting player will be randomly chosen, each player takes turns to build two settlements on the map, 
                    settlements can only be built in intersections of three tiles where only one settlement can be built at one intersection point. 
                    A settlement may only be built at an intersection point whether all other 3 adjacent intersection points are vacant.  
                    After  each player takes turns to build a road, a road can only be built while connected to their own settlement and in between two tiles.
                    The starting player will now begin his turn , he will have 5 options : roll the dice, trade, build, play a card and to end the turn.
